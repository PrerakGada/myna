// PillViewModel.swift — the @MainActor ObservableObject that bridges
// AudioPlayer state and the SwiftUI pill view.
//
// Owns:
//   - derived `isSpeaking` (folds AudioPlayer's playing/paused into a
//     single "the pill should be visible" boolean)
//   - expand/collapse + pin state (hover, click-to-pin, dismiss)
//   - "voice label" (sourced from PillBridge first, then SettingsViewModel)
//   - "preview text" (sourced from PillBridge; nil otherwise)
//
// Does NOT own the NSPanel — that's PillController's job. The split
// keeps the view model trivially previewable in SwiftUI (no AppKit
// dependency in this file beyond `import AppKit` for nothing).
