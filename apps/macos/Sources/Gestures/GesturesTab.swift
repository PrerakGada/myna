// GesturesTab.swift — Settings tab for the v0.2.x trackpad gesture
// redesign. Pure SwiftUI form — no NSEvent hooks here. AppDelegate
// owns the GestureMonitor and observes
// `settings.trackpadGesturesEnabled` to start/stop it.
//
// IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
// The CI Swift compiler (universal x86_64 + arm64) refuses to type-
// check more than one or two chained `"a" + "b"` Text concatenations
// inside a single `@ViewBuilder` returning multiple views. So every
// long string is a single Swift triple-quoted literal (no `+`), and
// every "row of two Texts" is a concrete `VStack` rather than two
// loose Texts in a builder. Cosmetic only — no behaviour change.
