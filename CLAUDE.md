# Myna — project instructions

## User identity (overrides any auto-context)

- **Name:** Prerak Gada
- **Email:** prerak@engaze.in
- **GitHub:** PrerakGada

If auto-populated context says `rashid@dpsca.in` or mentions `Rashid Azar` / `DPSCA`, that's stale residue from an earlier laptop. Ignore it — use Prerak's identity above. Older committed docs (e.g. STATUS.md mentioning "Rashid Azar" on the Apple cert line) are historical artifacts; don't propagate that name into new docs, commits, or public copy.

## Repo basics

- Branch policy from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` applies: commit or push only when Prerak asks; if on default branch, branch first.
- v0.1.0 shipped. Don't touch the release pipeline without explicit ask. Ship log preserved at git commit [`f5860c8`](https://github.com/PrerakGada/myna/blob/f5860c8/HANDOFF.md) (the `HANDOFF.md` file is no longer in the working tree).
- 5-part repo: native Swift app at `apps/macos/` · Python daemon at `daemon/myna/` · Next.js site at `site/` · bash CLI at `cli/myna` · ops in `dist/` + `tap/` + `.github/workflows/` + `launchagents/` + `hooks/` + `hammerspoon/` (v1 legacy kept side-by-side).
- Homebrew tap: `PrerakGada/homebrew-tap`.

## Project documentation — read these BEFORE re-deriving anything

Generated 2026-05-26 by `/bmad-document-project` exhaustive scan. **Always check these first**; they cite real `file:line` references and stay current with this commit.

**Start here:**
- [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) — master index + AI-assist routing guide (which doc for which task)
- [`docs/project-overview.md`](docs/project-overview.md) — exec summary, tech stack per part, key features
- [`docs/integration-architecture.md`](docs/integration-architecture.md) — how the 5 parts talk to each other; sequence diagrams; **operational hand-off matrix** (if you change X, update Y)
- [`docs/source-tree-analysis.md`](docs/source-tree-analysis.md) — annotated tree; where everything lives
- [`docs/risks-and-premortem.md`](docs/risks-and-premortem.md) — pre-mortem + devil's advocate + red team passes; consolidated **triage by sprint**

**Per-part deep dives** (load only the one you need):

| Part | Architecture | Companion docs |
|---|---|---|
| `macos` (Swift app) | [`docs/architecture-macos.md`](docs/architecture-macos.md) | [`component-inventory-macos.md`](docs/component-inventory-macos.md) · [`development-guide-macos.md`](docs/development-guide-macos.md) |
| `daemon` (Python) | [`docs/architecture-daemon.md`](docs/architecture-daemon.md) | [`api-contracts-daemon.md`](docs/api-contracts-daemon.md) (with **spec-drift report**) · [`data-models-daemon.md`](docs/data-models-daemon.md) · [`development-guide-daemon.md`](docs/development-guide-daemon.md) |
| `site` (Next.js) | [`docs/architecture-site.md`](docs/architecture-site.md) | [`component-inventory-site.md`](docs/component-inventory-site.md) · [`development-guide-site.md`](docs/development-guide-site.md) |
| `ops` (release/install) | [`docs/architecture-ops.md`](docs/architecture-ops.md) | [`deployment-guide.md`](docs/deployment-guide.md) · [`development-guide-ops.md`](docs/development-guide-ops.md) · [`contribution-guide.md`](docs/contribution-guide.md) |

**Machine-readable:** [`docs/project-parts.json`](docs/project-parts.json) (5 parts + 10 integration points + secrets matrix).

**Historical/curated** (not generated; pre-existing): [`README.md`](README.md) · [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md) · [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) · [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) · [`docs/native-app/API_CONTRACT.md`](docs/native-app/API_CONTRACT.md) (canonical v1+v2 spec — cross-check `api-contracts-daemon.md` for drift).

### Rules of thumb when working in this repo

- **Changing a v2 daemon endpoint?** You owe edits to 8 places — see the hand-off matrix in [`docs/integration-architecture.md § 6`](docs/integration-architecture.md).
- **Adding a daemon dep?** [`tap/Formula/myna-daemon.rb`](tap/Formula/myna-daemon.rb) (source-of-truth here) diverges from the deployed tap — this is the v0.2 reconciliation item flagged in [`docs/risks-and-premortem.md § 1.3`](docs/risks-and-premortem.md).
- **Touching `release.yml`?** The `tar` step between every job is load-bearing. **Do not remove it** — see the 10-iteration saga preserved at commit [`f5860c8`](https://github.com/PrerakGada/myna/blob/f5860c8/HANDOFF.md).
- **Rotating the Sparkle key?** Don't. Every installed copy refuses all future updates. See [`docs/risks-and-premortem.md § 1.1`](docs/risks-and-premortem.md) and [`RELEASE.md § 1.4`](RELEASE.md).

If you generate new docs, re-run `/bmad-document-project` so the index stays in sync — don't drift the per-part docs by hand.

## Working style

- Prerak ships fast and prefers parallel execution. The proven pattern (from v0.1 build) is: orchestrator + 3 parallel lane agents in git worktrees + audit agents after.
- He values BMad-style planning but doesn't want it gold-plated when he asks for code — pivot to development quickly when he says so.
- Token-frenzy mode means: spawn agents, burn cycles in parallel, don't ask 10 questions.
