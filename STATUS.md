# Myna v2 — Overnight Build Status

**Date:** 2026-05-25 → 2026-05-26
**Branch:** `native-app-rebuild` (15+ commits ahead of `main`; **not pushed** per repo policy)
**Run by:** Orchestrator (Opus) + 3 parallel lane agents (Opus, in worktrees) + 3 audit agents (Opus, sequential)

> Read this first. It tells you what shipped, what didn't, what needs your hands tomorrow, and how to launch the app right now.

---

## TL;DR

You went to bed with a 322-line Hammerspoon script. You wake up with:

- A native **Swift macOS menu-bar app** at `apps/macos/` — 40 source files, 90 passing tests, lint-clean, builds in 7s, **runs end-to-end against your existing daemon**.
- **AVAudioEngine-based playback** with real speed (no pitch shift), seek ±15s, scrub, pause/resume — the features the v1 `afplay` pipeline could never do.
- A **`myna://` URL scheme** wired through BetterTouchTool — your trackpad gestures can now drive the app directly without simulating keystrokes.
- **Settings UI** (Hotkeys / Voice / Daemon / Advanced tabs), persistent via `@AppStorage`.
- A **slimmed-down daemon** with 7 new v2 endpoints (`/v2/synthesize` streams WAV chunks, plus `/v2/status`, `/v2/voices`, `/v2/extract`, `/v2/summarize`, `/v2/health`, `/v2/synthesize-summary`). All 33 v1 tests still green; **94 daemon tests total**.
- A **release pipeline**: GitHub Actions `release.yml` that goes from `git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags` → signed + notarized + stapled `.dmg` → GitHub Release → Sparkle appcast updated → Homebrew cask bumped, all in one job.
- A **Homebrew tap** (`tap/Casks/myna.rb` + `tap/Formula/myna-daemon.rb`) ready to publish.
- **Sparkle 2 auto-updates** wired into the app (real EdDSA public key in `Info.plist`, private key gitignored on your machine — you stash it tomorrow).
- A **full audit trail** in `docs/native-app/audits/AUDIT_REPORT.md` — three independent code reviewers + one security reviewer ran against the integrated tree.

**Verdict:** v0.1.0 is releasable as soon as you do the one-time Apple Developer setup (~30 min, real money: $99/yr). Everything else is wired.

## What's complete

### Spec (Phase 0)
- [x] `docs/native-app/NATIVE_APP_PROPOSAL.md` — architecture, library choices, distribution model, risks
- [x] `docs/native-app/API_CONTRACT.md` — v1 endpoints (preserved) + v2 endpoints with canonical Swift and Python types
- [x] `docs/native-app/TEST_PLAN.md` — per-module test matrices the lanes built against
- [x] `docs/native-app/fixtures/*.json` — shared between Swift and Python test suites
- [x] `docs/native-app/audits/{CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST,SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST,AUDITOR_PROMPTS,INTEGRATION_PLAN,AUDIT_REPORT}.md`

### Lane A — Swift App Core
- [x] **Network** — `DaemonClient` (URLSession actor), `DaemonTypes`, `SynthesizeStream` (multipart parser handling partial boundaries). 17 tests.
- [x] **Audio** — `AudioPlayer` (AVAudioEngine + TimePitch), `PlaybackQueue` (virtual timeline across chunks). Speed change without pitch shift, real seek across chunks. 22 tests.
- [x] **Input** — `SelectionService` (Cmd+C simulation with pasteboard restore), `ChromeService` (NSAppleScript), `HotkeyManager` (KeyboardShortcuts library, 5 defaults matching v1). 14 tests.
- [x] **URLScheme** — `URLSchemeHandler` parsing `myna://` with input validation/clamping; explicitly NO arbitrary-text-speak route. 17 tests.
- [x] **MenuBar** — `MenuBarController` (polls `/v2/status` every 1.5s), `MenuBarView` (SwiftUI), `BirdIcon`. Covered via integration tests.
- [x] **Settings** — 4-tab `TabView` (Hotkeys, Voice, Daemon, Advanced), `SettingsViewModel` with `@Published` (Ventura-compatible — `@Observable` would require Sonoma). 8 tests.
- [x] **Logging** — `OSLog` + file mirror at `~/Library/Logs/Myna/myna.log`, in-app `LogViewerView`. 3 tests.
- [x] **Updates** — `UpdateController` (Sparkle 2) + `CheckForUpdatesMenuItem` SwiftUI view.

**Total: 40 Swift files, 90 tests, 0 SwiftLint violations, 0 swift-format warnings, clean Xcode build.**

### Lane B — Release Pipeline
- [x] `.github/workflows/release.yml` — 9-job pipeline triggered on `git tag v*`
- [x] `.github/workflows/appcast.yml` — manual appcast rebuild
- [x] `dist/{build,sign,notarize,dmg,appcast}.sh` + `_lib.sh` + `tests/test_scripts.sh` — 16/16 smoke tests pass
- [x] `tap/Casks/myna.rb` + `tap/Formula/myna-daemon.rb` — `brew style` clean
- [x] `RELEASE.md` — full operator manual (one-time setup, per-release, rollback, manual fallback)
- [x] Sparkle EdDSA keys generated; public key in `project.yml` + `Info.plist`; private key gitignored

### Lane C — Daemon Refactor
- [x] 7 new v2 endpoints: `/v2/synthesize`, `/v2/synthesize-summary`, `/v2/status`, `/v2/voices`, `/v2/extract`, `/v2/summarize`, `/v2/health`
- [x] `daemon/myna/v2_types.py` — Pydantic models matching API_CONTRACT.md
- [x] Version bumped: `0.1.0 → 0.2.0` in `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`
- [x] All 33 v1 tests still pass + 49 new v2 tests + 12 audit-regression tests = **94 total**
- [x] `app.state.player` is NOT touched by any v2 endpoint (verified with trip-wire `FakePlayer` in tests)

### Audits (L0 — independent of implementers)
- [x] Lane C code review — APPROVED with follow-ups; 2 🔴 fixture-conformance issues fixed in commit `5b8f7f6`
- [x] Lane B code review — initially BLOCKED (leaked Sparkle key + broken openssl); both 🔴 fixed in commit `3fbd4b0`
- [x] Lane A code review — APPROVED with follow-ups; two real-bug 🟡 (CFBundleShortVersionString flow + nil-safe terminate) fixed in commit `2bc4583`
- [x] Security review (integrated branch) — APPROVED with follow-ups; no 🔴 critical; two real 🟡 (pasteboard `defer` + AppleScript timeout) fixed in commit after `18c9de7`

## What needs your hands tomorrow

### Critical path to v0.1.0 release (one-time, ~45 min)

1. **Get an Apple Developer ID Application certificate.**
   - Sign in at https://developer.apple.com (renews $99/yr)
   - Certificates → Production → Developer ID Application → generate
   - Download `.cer`, double-click to add to Keychain
   - In Keychain Access, find it, right-click → Export `.p12` (set a password)
   - `base64 -i ~/Downloads/DeveloperID.p12 | pbcopy` — paste into GitHub secret `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_P12`
   - The p12 password → secret `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_P12_PASSWORD`
   - The identity name (`security find-identity -v -p codesigning` → e.g. "Developer ID Application: MIND WEALTH (RC63N3VU27)") → secret `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_NAME`

2. **Generate an app-specific password.**
   - https://appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords → +
   - Label it "Myna notarization" → copy
   - → secret `APPLE_ID_APP_PASSWORD`. Also set `APPLE_ID` (your email) and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (10-char from developer.apple.com → Membership).

3. **Stash the Sparkle private key.**
   - It's at `dist/sparkle_private_key.NEVER_COMMIT.txt` (gitignored, won't get committed).
   - Open it: `cat dist/sparkle_private_key.NEVER_COMMIT.txt` — value is one line of base64.
   - Put it in 1Password as "Myna Sparkle EdDSA private key".
   - Put the same value in GitHub secret `SPARKLE_EDDSA_PRIVATE_KEY`.
   - **Then delete the local file** (`rm dist/sparkle_private_key.NEVER_COMMIT.txt`) — you don't need it on disk.

4. **Set `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`.** Any random string: `openssl rand -base64 24 | pbcopy`. → GH secret.

5. **Create the Homebrew tap repo.**
   - `gh repo create PrerakGada/homebrew-tap --public`
   - Mirror `tap/Casks/` + `tap/Formula/` into it (one-time push)
   - Generate a deploy key with write access — public half on the tap repo, private half → GH secret `TAP_DEPLOY_KEY`

6. **Replace `CHANGEME` with your GitHub handle.** Three places:
   ```bash
   sed -i '' 's/CHANGEME/PrerakGada/g' \
     apps/macos/project.yml \
     dist/appcast.sh \
     tap/Casks/myna.rb \
     tap/Formula/myna-daemon.rb
   cd apps/macos && xcodegen generate    # regen Info.plist with the real SUFeedURL
   ```

7. **Push the branch.**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Developer/myna
   git push -u origin native-app-rebuild
   # then open a PR, review the diff, merge into main
   ```

8. **Tag and release.**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags
   ```
   GitHub Actions does the rest. First release takes ~15 min (notarize wait).

### Optional, but recommended for v0.1

- Add a DMG background image at `dist/dmg-background.png` (600×380). Without it, the DMG works but the install window has no branding.
- Test the URL scheme manually before tagging: `open "myna://toggle-pause"` while the app is running.
- Try the app yourself: instructions in the next section.

---

## Try it out locally (right now, before any release setup)

```bash
cd ~/Developer/myna
git status     # should show "On branch native-app-rebuild, working tree clean"

# 1. The Python daemon should already be running (your existing LaunchAgent).
#    Confirm:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8766/v2/health
# expect {"ok":true,"version":"0.2.0","engine_up":true}  (or engine_up:false if Kokoro is off)

# 2. Build the Swift app.
cd apps/macos
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme Myna -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" \
  CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

# 3. Open it.
open build/Build/Products/Debug/Myna.app
# Bird icon appears in your menu bar. macOS will prompt for Accessibility +
# AppleScript permissions on first hotkey / first read-chrome.

# 4. Select some text in any app and press ⌘⌥⇧S — Myna speaks it.
#    Press ⌘⌥⇧Space to pause/resume.
#    Menu bar → Speed → 1.5× — speed up without pitch change.

# 5. Quit Myna when done (menu → Quit Myna or ⌘Q).
```

The v1 Hammerspoon script also keeps working; both can run side-by-side (second hotkey registration wins; in practice you'll keep one or the other).

## Known issues / 🟡 follow-ups

These aren't blockers for v0.1 but worth fixing in v0.2:

### From Lane C audit (daemon)
- 🟡 Mid-stream synthesize failure silently truncates with `ok: true`. The Swift client compares `chunks` to `X-Chunk-Total-Estimate` so it detects the truncation, but the contract should explicitly emit an error field. Spec change first, then code.
- 🟡 `/v2/status.state` never emits `synthesizing` / `streaming` — the daemon doesn't track in-flight v2 syntheses. Feature gap.
- 🟡 v1 `_producer` writes WAVs to `~/.cache/myna/tmp/` and never cleans up. Tech debt (pre-existing).

### From Lane B audit (release)
- 🟡 `mapfile` in `dist/_lib.sh` isn't portable to bash 3 (macOS default). Use a `while read` loop.
- 🟡 `tap/Formula/myna-daemon.rb` `test do` asserts `"usage"` is in `myna-daemon --help` output — but the daemon has no argparse, so `brew test` will fail. Either add argparse or change the assertion.
- 🟡 `tap/Formula/myna-daemon.rb` writes `keybindings.json` to `etc/myna/` but `daemon/myna/config.py` hardcodes `~/.config/myna`. The two never meet. Drop the formula install (Swift app owns keybindings in v2) or make `config.py` respect `MYNA_CONFIG_DIR`.
- 🟡 `release.yml` appcast fetch uses `|| echo "no existing appcast"` which swallows real errors (auth glitch) and rewrites the appcast from scratch. Distinguish 404 from other failures.
- 🟢 minor nits about brew style, version_from_tag fallback masking empty MARKETING_VERSION, etc.

### From Lane A audit (Swift app) — **two real bugs already fixed**, rest deferred
- ✅ **FIXED** 🟡 `CFBundleShortVersionString` was hardcoded `"1.0"` instead of flowing `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` (`0.1.0`). Would have broken Sparkle's "newer version available" detection — every release would have reported "1.0" and Sparkle would never offer an update. Now reads `0.1.0` in the built `.app` (verified with `PlistBuddy`).
- ✅ **FIXED** 🟡 `AppDelegate.applicationWillTerminate` force-unwrapped IUO singletons that are nil under XCTest; crashed the test host on bundle unload. Now gated on a `didBootstrap` flag.
- 🟡 `fatalError` reachable in `AudioPlayer.swift:341` on temp-file write failure during mid-chunk seek. Should return early with a logged error instead. Deferred (rare path, gracefully degrades).
- 🟡 `DaemonError.transport(String)` drifts from spec's `transport(Error)`. Cosmetic; update the spec OR the type. Deferred.
- 🟡 `VoicesResponse.engine: String?` was added in the Swift type but isn't in `API_CONTRACT.md § 4`. Update the spec to match. Deferred.
- `AudioPlayer.position` uses wall-clock (`CACurrentMediaTime`) not sample-accurate `AVAudioTime`. Fine for UI; revisit if we add AV sync.
- `SettingsViewModel` uses `ObservableObject + @Published` instead of `@Observable` (Sonoma+). Migration is one targeted edit when you bump the min macOS.
- Settings → "Restart Daemon" hard-codes the plist path `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.myna.daemon.plist`. Lane B may rename this — keep them in sync.

### From Security review — **two real fixes applied**, one manual step for you
- **🟠 SUFeedURL contains `CHANGEME`** in `apps/macos/project.yml:53` / `Info.plist:47` / `dist/appcast.sh:49,199`. You replace this with your GitHub username before tagging v0.1.0 (covered by the `sed` command in § "What needs your hands tomorrow" step 6).
- ✅ **FIXED** 🟡 `SelectionService.captureSelectedText` would skip the pasteboard restore on `Task` cancellation during the 120ms sleep. Hoisted into a `defer` block — restores on every exit path now.
- ✅ **FIXED** 🟡 `ChromeService` AppleScript had no timeout — a wedged Chrome could hang the menu bar indefinitely. Now carries `with timeout of 5 seconds … end timeout`.
- 🟡 `/v2/synthesize` and v1 `_speak` don't re-validate URL scheme before calling `extract` (defense-in-depth — trafilatura only fetches http(s) anyway). Deferred.
- 🟢 Four Lows: key-file mode, URL-in-log redaction (none currently logged but worth a comment), nested-helper entitlements, v1-era README phrasing about Hammerspoon. All cosmetic.

**Overall security verdict (auditor's words):** *"The integrated `native-app-rebuild` branch is in good security shape. No 🔴 Critical findings. URL-scheme parsing dropped or safely clamped all 11 adversarial inputs (verified by a new XCTest). Pasteboard handling is correct. Entitlements are minimal and hardened-runtime-friendly. Daemon binds 127.0.0.1 only with no `eval`/`exec`/`shell=True`. Signing pipeline uses the right flags. No telemetry SDKs. Sparkle public key is real and consistent across project.yml and Info.plist; private key gitignored and verified absent from the tree."*

## The path to v0.2 and beyond (after v0.1 ships)

Once v0.1 is in users' hands and the release pipeline has run end-to-end at least once:

- **v0.2** — Settings UI polish, live voice picker queried from `/v2/voices`, in-app log viewer improvements, the 🟡 follow-ups above.
- **v0.3** — Ship a ready-made BetterTouchTool preset file users can import (`docs/btt-myna-preset.bttpreset` — write a JSON exporter), and document the trackpad-gesture flow in the README.
- **v0.4** — Port the daemon's `chunking.py` + `summarize.py` + `extract.py` to Swift, fold them into the app, kill the Python dependency, ship single-binary `.app`. Daemon becomes a thin wrapper around Kokoro that the Swift app still talks to.
- **v1.0** — Public launch. Hacker News, r/macapps, Product Hunt. README with a screencap. The whole "always-on local TTS" pitch.

## Honest assessment of what didn't happen

- **No real notarization run.** The pipeline is structurally correct and `--dry-run` passes, but the first real notarization needs your Apple credentials and will probably have one hiccup the first time (it always does). Budget 30 min for that on your first tag push; the `RELEASE.md` manual fallback covers what to do.
- **No real Sparkle update tested.** The first release establishes the appcast; the second release tests that v0.1 → v0.2 actually updates. You can't validate the loop until at least two real releases exist. Plan a "dummy v0.1.1" deploy if you want to validate before announcing.
- **No screenshots in the README.** Wait for you to launch the app and grab them.
- **BetterTouchTool preset not shipped.** Documented but not auto-generated. Listed as v0.3 work.
- **No CONTRIBUTING.md.** Add when you open the repo to outside contributors.
- **The `_bmad/` / `.agents/` / `site/` directories** existing from prior work are gitignored, not removed. If you want a clean repo you can `rm -rf` them later.

## Branch policy

Per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` rule "Commit or push only when the user asks. If on the default branch, branch first.": **the orchestrator has not pushed.** Branch `native-app-rebuild` is local-only. Your first `git push` will publish it.

Recommend: push, open a PR against `main` so you get a final diff view, merge into main, then tag.
