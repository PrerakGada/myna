    <<~EOS
      Myna's daemon is now installed.

      Start it (and have it relaunch on boot) with:
        brew services start myna-daemon

      The daemon expects an mlx-audio Kokoro TTS engine on http://127.0.0.1:8765.
      That engine is too heavy to bundle via brew. Install it yourself with:

        python3.13 -m venv ~/.venvs/mlx-audio
        ~/.venvs/mlx-audio/bin/pip install mlx-audio

      Then run the engine (or wrap it in your own LaunchAgent):
        ~/.venvs/mlx-audio/bin/python -m mlx_audio.server --port 8765

      Config lives in #{etc}/myna/.
      Logs:     #{var}/log/myna-daemon.log
    EOS

  test do
    # The package exposes a `myna` console-script that responds to --help.

end
